Milhouse
========

Persistent binary merkle tree in Rust, geared towards use in Ethereum consensus.

## What's with the name?

The name is a homage to Milhouse Van Houten, who we must assume knows a thing or two about trees
given his name â€“ _Houten_ being Dutch for "wooden". Dutch is also the native language of the
inimitable Protolambda whose [remerkleable][] library was a great inspiration.
